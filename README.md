Job App using The Public Employment Service (Arbetsf√∂rmedlingen) open API. 

The goal of this project was to practice techniques for version management, working methods, development principles and quality assurance as well as try mob programming and pair programming. Requirements were listing 10 latest jobs, displaying total number of vacancies in the chosen municipality, pagination, list ads by profession and share a specific job with a permanent link. 

To lower the website's bounce rate, a single page ad is introduced, with a new creation of URL. Further, to make the app more valuable to job seekers, job-ads are saved in order to access them again more swiftly by appearing in a list on the website-app. When clicked, the details of the specified job ad are displayed.
